    <h1>About me</h1>
    

    <p>When I took my first college physics class, I remember being fascinated with how mathematics could demystify complex systems through modeling. This fascination led me to Vanderbilt University to study systems biology, a subfield of biology that uses big data, mathematics and statics.</p>
<p>At Vanderbilt I worked with biologists, statisticians, and mathematicians to predict more effective cancer therapies. What I enjoyed the most was bringing a quantitative angle to study difficult problems, leveraging big data and modeling. Seeking to build upon this theme led me to study genomics at Stanford University, using programming and statistical inference to analyze millions of DNA reads. Most recently, I'm in the 2016 Insight Data Science Silicon Valley session.</p>
